// code formatting types: formatting rules differ between languages ,
// so we should follow language specific conventions and guidelines

// 1. Vertical Formatting:
    // 1.1.Space Between Lines :
    // 1.2.Space Between Code: different concepts(areas) should be separated by spacing and similar concepts should not be separated
    // related concepts should be kept close to each other

    // 1.3.Grouping of Code: consider splitting files with multiple concepts

// 2.Horizontal Formatting:
    // 2.1. Indentation
    // 2.2. Line Width: break long statements into shorter ones
    // 2.3. use clear but not unreadable long names
